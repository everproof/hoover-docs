# Webhooks

The verification results are sent asynchronously.

Pass along a `webhookUrl` parameter in every request body, that contains the location you'd like us to POST your verification results to.

To connect our response to your initial request, you must pass a `trackingId` parameter in your request body too. We’ll pass this identifier back to you with the webhook request.

**If you return anything other than an HTTP 200 status to the webhook POST then we’ll try to deliver the webhook up to 3 times with an exponential backoff.**

### Securing webhooks

We will sign the webhook requests before we send them to your endpoints. We do so by including a header `Everproof-Signature`. This allows you to validate that the events were sent by Everproof, not by a third party. You can verify signatures using by using your API key and the raw body of the request. Make sure to strip the prefix (pk_) from the start of the key before generating the HMAC.

Header | Name   
-------------------- | ------
Everproof-Signature  | An SHA1 HMAC hexdigest
